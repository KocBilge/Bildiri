      "description" : "The AmeriCorps Office of Research and Evaluation provides grants to researchers, scholars, and dissertators at institutions of higher education, enabling them to engage in comprehensive studies on civic engagement, volunteering, and national service. Studies include a variety of populations and ranges from local to organizational, and national contexts throughout the United States. \n\nThis AmeriCorps Research Grantee dataset provides comprehensive information about the grantees and their studies. For each award, we identify the: 1) study title; 2) background; 3) cohort year; 4) principal investigators and their affiliated university; 5) study location(s) associated with each grant; 6) civic engagement topic areas; and 7) the research approach. Please be aware that there may be multiple rows corresponding to a single research grantee study, reflecting the various study sites where the grantee is actively involved. \n\nEach study was thematically coded to identify their civic engagement topic areas. An individual study can be categorized into more than one group. The topic areas include: \n•\tArts & Culture, \n•\tCommunity Development, \n•\tEducation Across the Life Course, \n•\tYouth Development, \n•\tEnvironment and Climate Change, \n•\tHealth & Social Wellbeing,\n•\tImmigrants, Immigration & Refugees, \n•\tEconomic Opportunity and Employment, \n•\tSocial Equity, \n•\tSenior Development, and \n•\tVolunteering, Nonprofit Studies, and National Service.  \n\nAdditionally, the research grantees’ studies were categorized into two distinct research approaches: traditional research and participatory research.\n\nTo learn more about the studies’ civic engagement topic areas and research approaches, please refer to the AmeriCorps Research Grantee Data Dictionary under Attachments.\n\nFor up-to-date information surrounding the AmeriCorps Research Grantees please see:\n•\tWhat is a Research Grant? https://americorps.gov/sites/default/files/document/What%20is%20a%20Research%20Grant_053023_final_508.pdf\n•\tAmeriCorps Research Grantee Activities and Insights: https://americorps.gov/grantees-sponsors/research-evaluation/grantee-profiles\n•\tParticipatory Research: https://americorps.gov/sites/default/files/document/2021_07_20_ParticipatoryResearchOnePager_ORE.pdf",

To explore these open questions, qualitative interviews will be conducted with approximately 20 Black parents in Southeastern Michigan. The main research question motivating this study is: how do Black parentsʹ critical analysis of social and educational inequities influence their motivations to interact with their children's school? These data will be analyzed using inductive and iterative approaches. Themes from the qualitative data will be used to develop an instrument to measure parental CC.
